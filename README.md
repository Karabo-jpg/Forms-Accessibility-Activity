## 🔍 What Teammates Need to Add

### For the Validation Lead:
Look for comments in `index.html` that say:
```html
<!-- VALIDATION LEAD: Add validation attributes here -->
```

**Specific tasks:**
1. Add `required` to all four inputs (fullName, email, password, terms)
2. Add `minlength="8"` to the password field
3. Add `pattern="^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$"` to the password field
4. Test that validation works in different browsers

### For the Accessibility (ARIA) Lead:
Look for comments in `index.html` that say:
```html
<!-- ACCESSIBILITY LEAD: Add ARIA attributes here -->
```

**Specific tasks:**
1. Add `role="form"` to the `<form>` element
2. Add `aria-describedby="passwordRequirements"` to the password input
3. Ensure the checkbox is properly labeled for screen readers
4. Test with a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
5. Run an accessibility checker (e.g., WAVE, axe DevTools)

- [ ] **Empty form submission** - Should show validation errors
- [ ] **Invalid email** (e.g., `abc@`) - Should show email format error  
- [ ] **Weak password** (e.g., `pass123`) - Should fail pattern validation
- [ ] **Short password** (e.g., `Pass1`) - Should fail minlength validation
- [ ] **Unchecked terms checkbox** - Should prevent submission
- [ ] **Valid submission** - All fields filled correctly
- [ ] **Screen reader announcement** - Password requirements read aloud
